Hello World,

I'm figuring out what I can do with this jekyll web server. I want to master this tool, so I can
write interesting information about me in a very fancy way: everyone likes fireworks and cool
CSS animations and sprites.

I really like ruby language, however at work I'm building some mobile apps using `python` and `kivy`.
That's a very dangerous combination.

You can checkout what I'm currently working by peaking at this [ocular-security][site]
